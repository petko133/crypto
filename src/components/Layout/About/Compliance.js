            A strong compliance foundation is critical to Coinbaseâ€™s mission of
            being the most trusted crypto platform. Adherence to regulatory
            requirements in all jurisdictions in which Coinbase operates ensures
            that we keep our customers - and the broader financial ecosystem -
            safe. To this end, we have developed a Compliance Program that is
            rooted in best practices from traditional financial services as well
            as innovative, sophisticated compliance technology to bring the
            crypto industry forward. We hold a high standard for what assets we
            list, what services we provide, and who has access to our products.
